title: Australian Army Reserves
---

Since joining the Australian Army Reserves in 2020, I am asked nearly weekly by a colleague, friend or family member what being an Army Reservist means and what we actually do. It is apparent that many people have considered it at one time or another as an interesting and challenging thing they might like to do, but it seems too intimidating or beyond them for some reason. I hope this post will help demystify the Army Reserves and encourage more people to reconsider!

## The Journey
I feel it is worth mentioning, just in case you are nervous just thinking about applying that you don't need to be 100% sure about your decision to join the Reserves before you apply. You can withdraw from the application process at any time leading up to the eventual day that you sign your contract and make your oath to our King (we are still part of the Commonwealth, remember) and to the Australian Government. The application process is just as much about you assessing the Australian Defence Force (ADF) as it is about the ADF assessing you.

1. **Visit** the [Defence Jobs](https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/) website and have a look at some of the Reserve jobs available.
2. **Find** a job role that interests you, and take a look at things like the Job Overview, the Pay and the other Benefits.

> Make sure you are looking at the Reserve (PART TIME) version of the role:
> ![army-reserve-roles]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/army-reserve-roles.png)

1. **Click** 'Apply Now' button on the job role page (or up the top in the nav bar) and follow the prompts to create an account on the 'Candidate Hub'.

> Review the [Application Process](https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/joining/how-to-join/recruitment-process) page and this [summary document](https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/-/media/DFR/Files/DFT_Overview_of_Recruiting_Process_.pdf) to see what Defence Jobs says but I'll add my take on the process based on my experience.

4. **YOU Session** - Schedule in and attend a YOU Session, which is a half day at one of the Defence Jobs centres around the country. 
  - You will go through a couple of presentations about Army life from a few different Defence members.
  - You will have ample opportunity to ask any questions about service life, the application process, the job you are interested in, etc.
  - You will complete some of the paperwork for your application, bring in your ID documents, sign for a police check and a few other admin things. Get used to this, the ADF loves paperwork.

5. **Aptitude Test** - Still at the YOU Session, you will complete an Aptitude Test, now rebranded as the 'Job Opportunities Test'. This is an honestly weird and abstract set of multiple choice questions designed to assess the way you think and your ability to problem solve. As far as I know you cannot fail but the better you do, the more job roles will be available to you. I haven't heard of anybody reaching the 'end' of the test, it potentially has no end but the aim is progress as far as you can within the time limit (I assume).

There are a handful of websites that have unofficial Australian Army Aptitude Test preparation question sets that might be worth doing if you are feeling nervous. The style of questions is not something I had done since maybe Year 5 or Year 6 at Primary School, questions like the below with highly variable difficulty:

- A car travels 18km in 45 minutes, how far will it travel in 2 hours?
  - 36km
  - 40km
  - 44km
  - 48km

- What is the next number in the pattern: `1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6, 4, __`
  - 3
  - 4
  - 6
  - 8

6. **Career Coach** - If the YOU Session went well, you will then be scheduled in to meet with a Career Coach, this used to be in person but seem to all be phone or Zoom style sessions now since COVID. This is to talk about the role you might be applying for, making sure you understand some of the basics about service life and to help prepare you for the rest of the process.

7. **Assessment Day** - Another half day at one of the Defence Jobs centres, you will get your Medical checkup with a Defence Doctor - basic things like mobility, basic body functions and reflex tests. A Psychological interview where I suggest you open up properly, they will see through any shenanigans and remember, the Psychologists are there to make sure that you are going to be able to deal with the unique pressures of service life. 

8. **Defence Interview** - If both of the above assessments goes well, you will get passed to a Defence Member to go through your Defence Interview. Don't stress about this stage, they are not there to trip you up, they want you to succeed but they also want to know that you are genuinely interested in service life, the role you've applied for, and are prepared to put in the effort to succeed. Highly recommend giving the [adffitness.com](https://www.adffitness.com.au/recruitment/recruitment-2-2-assessment-day-defence-interview/) a good read, you don't need to memorise everything but it's a great sample of the kinds of things to research, understand and be prepared to talk about.

9. **Officer Selection** - If you are applying to be an Officer, you'll need to go through the Officer Selection Board but I can't comment on this stage. Personally though, as a Reservist, given it's a part time role, it seems like more fun to be General Entry - just my 2c, YMMV depending on your longer term civilian and military career and life goals.

10. **Fitness Test** - if you've smashed all the previous steps over the course of a few (or many) months you'll need to attend a Military Base in just your civilian fitness wear (stick with tee shirt and shorts), with decent quality running shoes with good support for the beep test, you don't want sloppy shoes as you pivot. You are doing the [Personal Fitness Assessment](https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/-/media/DFR/Files/Training-for-the-PFA-Brochure.pdf) (PFA) - you'll do this a few weeks before you go off to Basic Training, again while you're at Basic a couple of times and then never again unless you go Infantry in which case, PT is what you signed up for. If you cannot smash [these minimum requirements](https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/joining/can-i-join/health-and-fitness) before signing up, emphasis on `minimum` have a serious think about how badly you really want to join:
- 7.5 on the Beep Test (aka Shuttle Run)
  - This is only 1.1km and takes about 7 minutes to complete
- 15 Pushups
- 45 Situps

Be aware, during the first week of your Basic Training, you will need to do the slightly harder [Basic Fitness Assessment](https://content.defencejobs.gov.au/pdf/army/Army_Physical_Continuum_Information.pdf) (BFA) which is something you'll need to be able to achieve at least yearly as a fitness compliance thing for the remainder of your Defence career which includes (for a 17-25 Male, varies per age bracket):
- 2.4km run in 11m 18s, not difficult at all with a base level of fitness
- 40 Pushups
- 70 Situps

..and for the 17-25 Ladies:
- 21 Pushups
- 70 Situps
- 2.4km run in 13m 30s

Keep in mind, in that first week of Basic Training you are tired, eating an Army diet, sleeping in a new environment and getting the full shock an awe treatment so you really need to be prepared to smash this even at you're less than 100% optimal energy levels.

I recommend the ADF Active mobile apps if you need some guidance training:
- [ADF Active for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/adf-active-entry-fitness-prep/id1293626109)
- [ADF Active for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.gov.defencejobs.adfactive2&hl=en_AU&gl=US&pli=1)

## Tips and Tricks before we get Started
Even though the Reserves is a part time commitment, it is still a commitment and the ADF will expect to see you put in some effort to get through the application process. Some tips and tricks to help you smash through:
- Always chase Defence Force Recruiting, they have so many candidates and so few staff, call them, email them, stay on them like a rash if you want to get it done.
- Read and understand as much as you can about the role you think you're interested in.
- Try to find a Defence member in your circle of family, friends or colleagues to chat about service life. The chances are high that you know someone that knows someone serving in the ADF.
- Understand where the [ADF has been deployed](https://www.defence.gov.au/operations) to in the past, and where we are deployed now.
- Understand why we have been deployed what we have done on those operations.
- Discuss with your family and spouse in particular about what you are considering, it is really important that you go into this with their support particularly when you are away from home on [Basic Training](https://www.army.gov.au/our-life/training/soldier-training/part-time-soldier-training) and your Initial Employment Training (IETs) which varies between Corps and job roles.
  - Note: Your family might be afraid that you are going to get sent straight to the trenches, see the below section on what the [Army Reservers isn't](#what-the-reserves-is-and-is-not).
- Understand that becoming a Defence Member means you are now representing Defence in everything you do going forward including your social behaviour, the way you interact online etc.

## What the Reserves Is and Is Not
My Mum had fears of trench warfare and grave danger every time I put my uniform on. My partner didn't really understand what I was doing or why but supported me despite her fear that I would be shipped off and away from home for months at a time. 

For the Mums out there - the reality is that Australia maintains a Defence Force, not an Attack Force. We are not aggressive in our foreign policies and have been primarily a peacekeeping force for decades. The Reserves is also increasingly becoming a [DACC](https://www.defence.gov.au/programs-initiatives/support-australian-community) focussed workforce which means assisting with Bushfires, Floods, and other Civil emergencies when called upon which is something I am proud to be a part of.

For the partners out there - I can't speak to full time service, but for Reserves, the ADF is very flexible and aware of the impact to families. Nearly all Reserves activities are opt-in, if you can't make you just inform your chain of command when they advertise the activities and that's it - rarely ever is there a real push for attendance but even so, if you're busy, you're busy. Civilian work, spouse, kids, family, friends all need to be considered.

The usual cadence, at least in my experience is roughly like this:
- Every Tuesday night from 7pm - 10pm
- 1 Weekend per Month
  - These can be Friday 7pm through to Sunday 5pm or Saturday morning through Sunday afternoon
- 1-2 Weeks once or twice per Year for IETs, Excercises and Operations
- Many other opportunities throughout the year for days, weeks and months long Operations, support tasks and general duties if you're available

With all the above said, remember you are absolutely becoming a soldier. You are a soldier first, and your job role second. You will be trained to use the [ADF weapons](https://www.army.gov.au/our-work/equipment-uniforms/equipment/small-arms) and [combatives](https://kineticfighting.com.au/2018/09/army-combatives-australia-aligned/) packages, as well as learn [Tactical Combat Casualty Care](https://cove.army.gov.au/article/ctc-live-fight-win-series-combat-first-aid) (TCCC) which is First Aid for combat wounds, serious stuff. This is the reality and this is what we train for.

Personally, I joined the Army Reserves to build skills and capability that I could not access as a Civilian and that is absolutely what Defence has delivered for me. They expect time and commitment from you and your family absolutely, but in return they give a lot back and you gain a whole new network of men and women that have your back and support you when you need it. Once you put on your uniform, you are part of a family. Defence supports members to bring their whole selves to work and provides a safe and welcoming culture - in my experience, everybody in my home unit have been awesome to work with, learn from and build friendships with.

Feel free to reach out with any questions, I've done my best to be descriptive without writing a novel and keep in mind, this post is 100% my own experience and opinions and not to be considered official information. Above all else, fall back on [DefenceJobs](https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/reserves) and don't be shy about picking up the phone and talking to them - they will help, they want to help, make the most of it.

Good luck and good soldiering,
