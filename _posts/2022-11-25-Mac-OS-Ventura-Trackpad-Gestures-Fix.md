title: Fix Trackpad Gestures after updating to Ventura
tags: mac
---

Every major MacOS update breaks something basic but super annoying.

Ventura broke my Trackpad gestures. Super. Annoying.

I tried a handful of technical fixes, but frustratingly the answer was just to open the Trackpad 'More Gestures' tab and change the `Swipe between full-screen applications` setting from `Swipe Left or Right with Three Fingers` to `Off` and then back again.

Repeat for Mission Control App Expos√© if you use those features.

Suddenly working again, :facepalm:

Happy Clouding,
